You'll build four simple websites using web development fundamentals, including HTML5/CSS3 and Bootstrap. You'll learn to understand and modify the structure of basic website, as well as how to change the way a page looks and is laid out.

Everything you see in a website is a result of the combination of HTML and CSS. With these two languages, you will have the skills you need to bring your website design to life. Jumpstart that vision by using Bootstrap, a popular library that allows you to create beautiful, responsive pages with very little time and experience.
