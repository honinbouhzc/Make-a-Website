# Make-a-Website
To build four simple websites using web development fundamentals, including HTML5/CSS3 and Bootstrap. You'll learn to understand and modify the structure of basic website, as well as how to change the way a page looks and is laid out.

Everything you see in a website is a result of the combination of HTML and CSS. With these two languages, you will have the skills you need to bring your website design to life. Jumpstart that vision by using Bootstrap, a popular library that allows you to create beautiful, responsive pages with very little time and experience.

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to give websites structure with text, links, images, and other fundamental elements.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to change the appearance of HTML elements.

An individual page of a website is referred to as a webpage. Notice the webpage in the web browser. We will explore the HTML elements used to build it. 

An important part of styling a webpage with CSS is organizing boundaries and space.

Every page element has boundary and space properties that can be controlled using CSS. The CSS box model illustrates each of these properties.

Observe the CSS box model diagram to the right:

content: Includes text, images, or other media contained within an HTML element.

padding: The space between the content and the border. You can think of this like inner space.

border: The outline of an HTML page element. You can think of it like a picture frame that contains the element.

margin: The space between the HTML page element and the next nearest element(s).

Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework with prewritten CSS rules designed to help you build webpages faster.

Take a look at the web browser. In this lesson, we will build this webpage up from scratch using a combination of Bootstrap and custom CSS.

Also in this lesson, we will encounter three new HTML elements:

header: Used to organize headers on a webpage.

footer: Used to organize footers on a webpage.

section: Defines sections on a webpage.

row: Arranges HTML elements in rows, and can be useful when building headers/navigation menus, main feature sections, supporting content sections and footers.

jumbotron: Used to create large showcase sections featuring important content.

col-sm-*: Used to span a specified number of columns on the Bootstrap grid. The "sm" is short for "small", and maintains desired CSS layouts on small screens (tablet-sized).

text-right: Bootstrap class used to orient text to the right side of the webpage.
btn btn-primary: Bootstrap class used to style page elements as buttons.
